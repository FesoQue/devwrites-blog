## SetUp

We will need to setup React and this will be done using vite ( a build tool for modern web projects). Go to your CLI and install `vite`. Note, you'll need need [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/) install for the npm command line tools

With NPM 7+:

```bash
npm create vite@latest my-react-app -- --template react
```

With Yarn:

```bash
yarn create vite@latest my-react-app -- --template react
```

Then run the following prompts

```bash
cd my-react-app

npm install
npm run dev
```

We can see the response we have below in our CLI, this shows that dev server is ready.

```bash
VITE v4.3.8  ready in 1025 ms

  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
  ➜  Network: use --host to expose
  ➜  press h to show help
```

One more package we need to install is `react-router-dom` which allows us to define route & navigate to different pages in your application"

With NPM:

```bash
npm install react-router-dom
```

With Yarn:

```bash
yarn add react-router-dom
```

Our setup is pretty much done, now let's move forward

## Our Folder Structure

This is the folder structure found in `src/`

```bash
src
|⁠—⁠—⁠— assets
     |⁠—⁠—⁠— react.svg
|⁠—⁠—⁠— App.css
|⁠—⁠—⁠— App.jsx
|⁠—⁠—⁠— index.css
|⁠—⁠—⁠— main.jsx
```

We need to delete unsed file like `index.css` and we end up having something like this

```bash
src
|⁠—⁠—⁠— assets
     |⁠—⁠—⁠— react.svg
|⁠—⁠—⁠— App.css
|⁠—⁠—⁠— App.jsx
|⁠—⁠—⁠— main.jsx
```

## Defining our routes

In the `main.js` file, we import `BrowserRouter` from `react-router-dom` and wrap our whole app with it.

```jsx
//main.jsx

import { BrowserRouter } from "react-router-dom";

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <BrowserRouter>
      <App />
    </BrowserRouter>
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```

We need to create two new files (`Home.jsx` and `About.jsx`) in our `src` folder. When that's done, let's go back to our `App.js` where we will import the `<Routes>` and `<Route>`components from `react-router-dom`.

```jsx
//App.jsx

import { Routes, Route } from "react-router-dom";
import Home from "./Home";
import About from "./About";
import "./App.css";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Routes>
      <Route path="/" index element={<Home />} />
      <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
    </Routes>
  );
};

export default App;
```

What we've done here is when the location changes we use `<Routes>` to looks through all its child routes to find the best match and renders that branch of the UI.

## How It Works

`Home.jsx` is the component that contains the link to the `about page`
